In this step, we will create an **Amazon S3 Bucket** to store images for the **Dental Clinic Management System**.

### Creating an S3 Bucket

1. Log in to the **AWS Management Console**.
2. Search for **Amazon S3**.
3. Select **Buckets**.
4. Select **Create bucket**.
5. Configure the Bucket with the following information:
   - **Bucket name:** `dental-service-images-huy`
   - **AWS Region:** `Asia Pacific (Singapore) - ap-southeast-1`
6. Keep the default settings and select **Create bucket**.

After successful creation, the Bucket will appear in the Amazon S3 Buckets list.

### Checking the Bucket

Select the **dental-service-images-huy** Bucket to check the stored objects.

In the Bucket, the system has organized folders to manage images by function:

- **avatars/**: Stores avatar images.

- **clinics/**: Stores clinic images.

- **services/**: Stores service images.

### Checking CloudFront

After successful creation, the Distribution status will change to **Enabled**.

Copy the CloudFront **Domain name** for use in the Backend or Frontend when accessing images.

After completing this step, the system will use CloudFront to distribute images from Amazon S3, speeding up loading and improving access performance.
After completing this step, Amazon S3 is ready for the Backend to store and retrieve system images.
